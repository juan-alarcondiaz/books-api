- Spring Boot 3.5.0
- Spring Data JPA
- Oracle Database
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Maven
- Lombok
- MapStruct

## Project Structure

The project follows a hexagonal architecture (also known as ports and adapters) with the following components:

- **Domain**: Contains the business models and exceptions
- **Application**: Contains the business logic, ports (interfaces), and adapters
- **Infrastructure**: Contains the controllers, repositories, DTOs, and mappers

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Maven 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Oracle Database (or use the provided Docker setup)

## Running the Application

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd books-api
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following environment variables:
   ```
   ORACLE_PWD=your_oracle_password
   DB_URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@oracle-db:1521:free
   DB_USER=system
   DB_PASS=your_oracle_password
   ```

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. The application will be available at http://localhost:8080

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd books-api
   ```

2. Make sure you have Oracle Database running and accessible

3. Set the following environment variables:
   ```
   DB_URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:YOUR_SID
   DB_USER=your_username
   DB_PASS=your_password
   ```

4. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   java -jar target/books.jar
   ```

5. The application will be available at http://localhost:8080
